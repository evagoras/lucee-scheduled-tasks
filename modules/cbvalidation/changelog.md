# CHANGELOG

## 1.5.1

* `bug` : This version's mixin is causing errors because its looking for this.validate() and its looking in the handler, not in the mixin file itself.

## 1.5.0

* `features` : `validateOrFail()` new method to validate and if it fails it will throw a `ValidationException`. Also if the target is an object, the object is returned. If the target is a struct, the struct is returned ONLY with the validated fields.
* `feature` : `validateModel()` is now deprecated in favor of `validate()`.  `validateModel()` is now marked for deprecation.
* `improvement` : Direct scoping for performance an avoidance of lookup bugs
* `improvement` : HTTPS protocol for everything
* `improvement` : Updated to testbox 3
* `bug` : Fix mapping declaration for apidocs`
