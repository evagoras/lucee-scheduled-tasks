# Lucee Administrator Scheduled Tasks Bootstrap UI
This is a ColdBox module for creating a front-end user interface based on Bootstrap 4 and jQuery that manages the server scheduled tasks, copying the Lucee Administrator functionality within a ColdBox app.

To use it, run the following command from CommandBox at the root of a ColdBox site:
```
install evagoras/lucee-scheduled-tasks
```
or if you are using the ForgeBox slug you can use this.
```
install lucee-scheduled-tasks
```
