# Lucee Administrator Scheduled Tasks Bootstrap UI
A front end user interface based on Bootstrap 4 and jQuery that manages the server scheduled tasks, 
copying the Lucee Administrator functionality.

To use it, first create a ColdBox site and then within CommandBox run the following command at the root of the site:
```
install evagoras/lucee-scheduled-tasks
```
or if you are using the ForgeBox slug
```
install lucee-scheduled-tasks
```
